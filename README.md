### ‚ö†Ô∏è Required: Enable `userChrome.css` Support in Firefox

Before custom themes can work, Firefox needs to allow UI customization:

1. Open Firefox and go to:
   ```
   about:config
   ```
2. Accept the warning if prompted.
3. Search for:
   ```
   toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets
   ```
4. Set it to `true` (double-click it to toggle).

5. Restart Firefox to apply the changes.

This tells Firefox to load your `userChrome.css` file at startup.

‚úÖ That‚Äôs it ‚Äî your config file will be created and you're ready to switch themes!
