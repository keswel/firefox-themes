## üé® How to Add Themes

`firefox-themes` comes with 4 built-in theme presets.

To add more themes:

1. Visit the [Firefox CSS Store](https://firefoxcss-store.github.io/)
2. Browse and install any theme you like
3. Copy the downloaded theme files into your selected theme folder  
   _(by default, this is `firefox-themes`)_
4. Restart Firefox ‚Äî you're done!

> üí° Themes usually include a `userChrome.css` file, sometimes along with other assets (images, variables, fonts, etc). Keep each theme in its own subfolder inside your theme directory for easy management.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Required: Enable `userChrome.css` Support in Firefox

Before custom themes can take effect, you must allow Firefox to load user styles.

1. Open Firefox and go to:
   ```
   about:config
   ```
2. Accept the warning if it appears
3. Search for:
   ```
   toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets
   ```
4. Set it to `true` (double-click to toggle)
5. Restart Firefox

This tells Firefox to load your `userChrome.css` file at startup.

‚úÖ That‚Äôs it ‚Äî your config will be saved and you‚Äôre ready to switch themes!
